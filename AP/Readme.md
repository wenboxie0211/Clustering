#Affinity propagation algorithm
- Affinity propagation algoithm is an unsupervised method that performs clustering of the input dataset
- It is claimed to better the kmeans algorithm and the GMM algorithm in the sense that both of them suffer if poorly initialised and the number of clusters have to be specified for kmeans algorithm

Affinity propagation algorithm is a message passing alternative optimisation algorithm that performs better than the kmeans algorithm
